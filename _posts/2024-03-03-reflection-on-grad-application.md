title:  "Notes on Grad School Application"
---

> There is a fair amount of videos, audios, and messages (mostly in chats with my friends) where I'm whining about the grad application process and stressing out about essays and interviews. While these emotions are still fresh in my memory (tbh, not all of them are, at this point), let's take notes.



- Don't stress too much about writing a *perfect* statement of purpose. Do you really think that 500 words are going to make that much difference against all everything else you put on the table? 



* Realize that there are *people* behind any admission process. And I mean 'people' in the most human, non-perfect, non-automatic, and subjective way possible. Yes, they are in charge of the decision, but their decision does not define you neither as a person nor as a professional.



* Same idea applies to supervisors - just *people*. Yes, some of them would like hear how you adore their research, and how you are inspired to work with such a great academic. Others will prefer more plain and straightforward communication. Write to them in a way you feel fits and use it as an opportunity for a vibe check.



* You *don't have to be an accomplished scientist or an expert* when applying. Neither universities nor PIs are expecting you to carry that level of knowledge and expertise - their job is to train you, not to recruit people who are already PhD-level scientists. Instead, show them that you have what it takes - passion, interest, perseverance, independence, ability to learn and think!



* Simple one: if admission rate is < 10%, then it's a lottery. Don't overthink it.
