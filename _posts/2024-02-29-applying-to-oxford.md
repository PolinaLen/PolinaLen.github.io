> IMP: This post IS NOT an applicaiton guideline or source of advice for aspiring grad students. This post IS NOTHING MORE than my recollection of the application process and emotions and thoughts that accompanied it.

### Looking for PhD positions
I have found my supervisor via Twitter!

### Statement of Purpose

#### What should be in the statement?
I'll have to mention that I am guilty of looking for sample essays in the internet. Unlike many others, [Hira's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@oxford_phd) was a helpfull resource which I liked because it gives you the right idea about the process. 

Overall, the essay must tell a story of how your skills and research interests have developed overtime and and why PhD should be the text step. Show them that you are up-to-date with trends in the field and their department/lab is a good match for what you are trtying to achieve.

### Interviews

#### First interview
The invitation came exactly 6 weeks after I had submitted my application. The first interview was expected to be very short: the instructions asked me to present my latest research project (1 slide) and answer questions from the comission. 

I gave a 10 minute talk about my BSc thesis (think microbial ecology) and answered a couple of questions based on the presentation. What caught we off guard is that both interviewers specialized in *very* distant fields, so I could see them being a bit lost in the topic. They have asked me pretty general questions, but because I didn't feel challanged I wasn't sure if I did well.

Since I assumed that Oxford admissions wouldn't waste their time on interviewing all of the applicants, I convinced myself that it was a reality check interview to see if I am actually close to what my CV said (LOL). Whether that was the real reason or not, we'll never know.

#### Second interview
That was a real-deal! The task was to choose a paper from the list of 10 and present the key points (10 mins, 5 slides). I have picked the closest one to my proposed research topic...
