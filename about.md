Hi and welcome to my page!

Maybe I will come up with some sort of creative introduction in the future, but meanwhile here is a couple of paragraphs about myself:

I am an early-career scientist and aspiring bioinformatician originally from a small city in the East Kazakhstan. 

My story in academia begun in 2021 when I joined [Barteneva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=85AUlREAAAAJ&hl=en) group at [Nazarbayev University](https//:nu.edu.kz) as a sophomore undergraduate student. During my first year in the lab, I participated in several projects related to COVID-19 and contributed to two manuscripts as a biostatistician.

I graduated from NU with BSc degree of Biological Sciences and minor in Computer Science in June 2023. Currently I continue to work as a research assistant for Dr Barteneva and focus on implementation of Nanopore sequencing to study microbial ecology and evolution.
