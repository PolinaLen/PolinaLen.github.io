How it all went...

##### **Early October**

- Exploring different labs to see if anyone is doing work related to phylogenetics, microbial evolution, origin of life, or similar fields. I really cared more about potential projects than the name of my department or degree.


##### **October 13**

- Not a big fan of the email-bombing multiple  supervisors, so I have sent an email to a single professor whose research group seemed to me as a good fit.

>Email to a potential supervisor:
>- introduce yourself and a subject of your inquiry
>- why are you interested in their research?
>- what are your current skills/experiences?
>- show that you might a good much
>- CV (I have attached mine, but some people would advise you not to)
>- make it clear in your email what kind of response you are waiting for (i.e. wondering if they are accepting MSc/PhD students? do you hope for a meeting? Make it straightforward and thus easier to answer)


##### **October 20**

- Found out that the supervisor in question is on sabbatical, so I have contacted a senior lab member. They have suggested that it is unlikely the professor is recruiting this year. 


##### **October 23-24**

- Followed up with professor and received a reply that the lab is not accepting PhD students in the current round.


~ Looking for gradschools elsewhere ~


##### **November 4-5**
- Accidentally discovered (via twitter) that a group lead from the MRC LMS - who is by the way working on chromatin evolution in bacteria and archaea! - is moving to Oxford and accepting PhD students.
- Dropped them an email and asked for an opportunity to discuss potential position in their lab
- Got a reply on the same day and decided on a timeslot for a meeting


##### **November 13**
- Had a meeting (interview?) with the potential supervisor

> Things you might want to discuss (not necessarily in this order):
> - potential projects you could undertake
> - supervisor's expectations
> - your expectations (imp!)
> - their supervision style
> - lab dynamics
> - funding opportunities
> - here is a [usefull post](https://twitter.com/PaolaVFigueroa/status/1312157953550479361?s=20) with more questions 


##### **December 1**
- Submitted my [DPhil application to the Department of Biochemistry](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-biochemistry)

>**Proposed field and title of research project** and **Proposed supervisor**
>I have chosen a single project (though it was possible to indicate up to 3) that was associated with my preferred supervisor
>	
>**Referees**
>My three referees were my current research supervisor (PI), internship supervisor, and university Professor/Academic adviser.
>	
>**Statement of Purpose**
>Among other things, here are 5 that I really tried ot emphasize in my essay:
>	 1) How have my interests in academia developed over time?
>	 2) How have these previous experiences prepared me for DPhil?
>	 3) Why am I a good fit for the program?
>	 4) Why is the program a good fit for me?
>	 5) Show that I am well versed and familiar with current trends in the proposed field


##### **January 8**
- Received invitation to interview with the Department
> Interview instructions: 
> - two group leaders from the biochemistry department
> - approximately 20 minutes
> - the task is to give a 10-minute presentation on a research project that you have previously worked on
> - a one page (A4 sized) presentation is allowed (must be provided in advance)


##### **January 16**
- Interview Day
- I presented a succinct summary of my BSc thesis to two members of the Department; however, my proposed research supervisor was not a part of the commission.
- I have been asked (more or less) general questions regarding the methodology and results of the project, as well as about my experiences and expectations in academia. Ones that I remember are
	* Tell us about a time when something wasn't working (i.e., experiments) and you had to think your way out of it?
	* How the skills that you already have will help you in your grad school?
	* What are the skills you want to learn while doing DPhil?
- I didn't have any definitive feeling about whether or not I did well, and it was primarely because I didn't feel challanged at any point of this interview - it was a nice chat, that's all. However, considering that Oxford faculty would most probably **not** waste their time interviewing students, my final assumption was that it has been a reality-check interview to see if my interview performance matches my application.

##### **January 17**

- Received an invitation for a follow up interview
> Interview instructions: 
> - the panel will consist of six group leaders from the biochemistry department
> - approximately 25 minutes
> - the task is to give a 10-minute presentation (up to five slides) on a research paper chosen from the list provided


##### **January 23**
- Interview Day
- I knew the names of faculty who would join my interview from the MTeams invite, so I've made a background check on all of them. It turned out to be interesting but not critical to my performance during the interview.
- Following all the instructions, I have presented paper of choice, and while - obviously - I do not have feedback from the commission, here are the things that *I believe* have made my presentation stronger:
	* putting the research into context, i.e., as a part of a bigger project done within a research group and its relation to the scientific field overall (though I could have done a better job for the latter)
	* drawing clear parallels between hypotheses, experiments, and conclusions
	* playing with figures, e.g. combining, adjusting, annotating, etc. 
- Questions that I was asked based on the paper:
	* Why did you choose this paper?
	* What is, in your opinion, the most crucial experiment in the paper and why?
	* What are the possible future research directions? Any unanswered questions?
	* Explain how does the [...]  technique work? (I mentioned it in the presentation) Can you think of any cases where this method will not succed?
	* *A question based on one of the Supplemental Figures*
- General questions:
	* What is a discovery that you think deserved the Nobel Prize (but didn't get it)?
	* What do you think is your most important skill/trait that will help you in gradschol?
- Even though the were no direct feedback after this stage, I knew that I nailed the interview! Ahaha, just a feeling!


##### **January 30**
- The University of Oxford has made me an offer of a place on the Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry


##### **January 31**
- Funding offer came in: Medical Sciences Graduate School Studentship


##### **February 27**
- Funding offer came in: Clarendon Scholarship scheme
