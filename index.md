Sup!
And welcome to my page!

I am an aspiring bioinformatician working in the field of microbial ecology. I am inspired by the questions on origin of life and evolutionary mechanisms behind eukaryogenesis! 

Here you can find updates on my first steps in academia and some useful materials that I discover and/or create.
