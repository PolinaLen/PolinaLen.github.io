title:  "Applying to Oxford"
---

I have accumulated a fair amount of videos, audios, and messages (mostly in chats with my friends) where I'm whining about the grad application process and stressing out about essays and interviews. The whole thing is actually mostly over, so I think that it is worthwhile to record some of the lessons and experiences for the future while they are still fresh (not all of them are, at this point, lol) in my memory.

> IMP: This post IS NOT an applicaiton guideline or source of advice for aspiring grad students. This post IS NOTHING MORE than my recollection of the application process and emotions and thoughts that accompanied it.
